# VLSM-Calculator

Simple VLSM calculator for C-class nets.

If an IPv4 address contains a number in the range of 192 to 223 in the first octet, it is a Class C address. Class C addresses were originally intended to support small networks. The first three octets of a Class C address represent the network number. The last octet may be used for hosts. One host octet yields 256 possibilities, which is the maximum amount of hosts in your network.

## Usage

To start program type 
```node calculator.js```
and use command 'ip'.

Then enter ip address you want to subnet and number of subnets.

Type 'exit' to quit.
